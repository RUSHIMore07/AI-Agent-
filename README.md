2. Initialize the system:
   # Set up OpenAI credentials
   openai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()
   os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = 'gpt-4o-mini'

   # Create crew instance
   crew = Crew(
       agents=[planner, writer, editor],
       tasks=[plan, write, edit],
       verbose=2
   )

3. Run the system:
   result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "Your Research Topic"})

OUTPUT STRUCTURE
---------------
The system produces content in the following format:
1. Research Plan
2. Draft Content
3. Edited Final Version

Each output includes:
